    <div class="about">
        <p class="aboute"> Dog Palace Kigali was founded in 2010. We take care of dogs that were previously abandoned and give them for adoption. Our mission is very simple,we believe that all dogs deserve to be happy, healthy and loved. While dogs are the cornerstone of our organisation, people who adopt them are paramount to our success. We certainly give all the necessities and frivolities for your adopted dog but we are also Kigaliâ€™s original community resource and gathering space for dog lovers. Simply put, we offer extraordinary service, valuable knowledge and care.Please adopt a dog and donate for Dog Palace to continue working.</p>
